    <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        Iguana is a genus of herbivorous lizards that are native to tropical
        areas of Mexico, Central America, South America, and the Caribbean. The genus was first described in 1768 by
        Austrian naturalist Josephus Nicolaus Laurenti in his book Specimen Medicum, Exhibens Synopsin Reptilium
        Emendatam cum Experimentis circa Venena. Two species are included in the genus Iguana: the green iguana, which
        is widespread throughout its range and a popular pet, and the Lesser Antillean iguana, which is native to the
        Lesser Antilles and endangered due to habitat destruction, introduced feral predators, hunting, and
        hybridization with introduced green iguanas.
        <br>
        The word "iguana" is derived from the original Taino name for the species, iwana.
        <br>
        In addition to the two species in the genus Iguana, several other related genera in the same family have common
        names of the species including the word "iguana".

    <h2 id="anatomy">Anatomy and physiology</h2>
    <p>
        Iguanas can range from 1.5 to 1.8 metres (5 to 6 ft) in length, including their tail. The two species of
        lizard
        within the genus Iguana possess a dewlap and a row of elongated scales running from the midline of their
        necks
        down to their tails. Iguanas have varying types of scales covering different areas of their body, for
        example,
        there are some large round tuberculate scales scattered around the lateral region of the neck among smaller,
        overlapping scales. The scales on the dorsal trunk of their body are also thicker and more tightly packed
        than those on the ventral side. These scales may be a variety of colors and are not always visible from
        close
        distances. They have a large round scale on their cheeks known as a sub-tympanic shield.
        <br>
        Iguanas have keen vision and can see shapes, shadows, colors, and movement at long distances. Their visual
        acuity enables them to navigate through crowded forests and to locate food. They employ visual signals to
        communicate with other members of the same species.
        <br>
        The tympanum, the iguana's eardrum, is located above the sub-tympanic shield (or "ear shield") behind each
        eye.
        Iguanas are often hard to spot, as they tend to blend into their surroundings and their coloration enables
        them
        to hide from larger predators.
        <br>
        Like most reptiles, an iguana has a three-chambered heart with two atria, one ventricle, and two aortae with
        a
        systemic circulation.
        <br>
        The muscles of an iguana are very light in color, this is due to the high proportion of fast glycolytic
        muscle
        fibers. These fibers are not very vascularized and are low in myoglobin, giving them their pale look. This
        high
        density of fast glycolytic muscle fibers allows iguanas to move very quickly for a short period of time,
        which
        facilitates short bursts of movement but is inefficient for long duration movement, since cellular
        respiration
        in fast glycolytic muscle fibers is anaerobic.
    </p>

    <h3 id="parietal">Parietal eye</h3>
    <p>
        Several species of lizard, including the iguana, have a pale scale towards the back of their head
        marking the
        parietal eye. This organ is photosensitive to changes in illumination and sends signals to the pineal
        gland
        signaling the change between day and night. A photopigment commonly found in the lamprey, known as
        parapinopsin,
        is also found in the iguana and is photosensitive to UV light and aids in the signaling between day and
        night.
    </p>

    <h3 id="skull">Skull morphology and diet</h3>
    <p>
        Iguanas have developed a herbivorous lifestyle, foraging exclusively on vegetation and foliage. In
        order to
        acquire, process and digest plant matter, herbivorous lizards must have a higher bite force relative
        to their
        size in comparison to carnivorous or omnivorous reptiles. The skull of the iguana has undergone
        modifications
        resulting in a strong bite force and efficient processing of vegetation, according to one study.
        <br>
        In order to accomplish this biomechanically, herbivorous lizards (such as the iguana) have taller
        and wider
        skulls, shorter snouts, and larger bodies relative to carnivorous and omnivorous reptiles.
        Increasing the
        robusticity of the skull allows for increased muscle presence and increases the ability of the skull
        to
        withstand stronger forces.
        <br>
        Furthermore, the teeth of the iguana are acrodontal, meaning that their teeth sit on top of the
        surface of the
        jaw bone and project upwards. The teeth themselves are small and serrated - designed to grasp and
        shear
        food.

    <h3 id="reproduction">Reproduction</h3>
    <p>
        Male iguanas, like other male examples of Squamata, have two hemipenes. During copulation one
        hemipene will be
        inserted into the female's cloacal vent. Females can store sperm from previous mates for several
        years to
        continue to fertilize her eggs in case she finds no male within her territory when she is ready
        to lay
        again.
    </p>

        alt="The early developed ovaries of an adolescent iguana shaded in red" />

    <h3 id="mating">Mating/courtship</h3>
    <p>
        Iguanas tend to follow a promiscuous or polygynadrous mating style during the dry season.
        Mating during the dry
        season ensures that their offspring will hatch during the wet or rainy season when food will
        be more plentiful.
        Females control large territories where they make several nests. Males compete amongst each
        other for the
        females in an area and mark their won territory with a pheromone secreted from the femoral
        pores on the dorsal
        side of their hind limbs. Male behavior during sexual competition involves head bobbing,
        extending and
        retracting their dewlap, nuzzling and biting the necks of females, and on occasion, changing
        color. Once a
        female chooses a male, he will straddle the female and hold her in place by biting onto her
        shoulder, which
        sometimes leaves scars on females. After copulation, eggs are laid within several nests and
        allowed to incubate.
        This low level of parental intervention with their offspring makes iguanas an example of
        r-strategy
        reproduction.
    </p>

    <h2 id="phylogeny">Phylogeny</h2>
    <p>
        A phylogeny based on nuclear protein-coding genes, reviewed by Vidal and Hedges (2009) suggested
        that the
        subclade Iguania is in a group with snakes and anguimorphs (lizards). These groups share an oral
        gland capable
        of secreting toxins (a derived trait). On the other hand, the phylogeny based on whole
        mitochondrial
        genomes, proposed by Rest et. al. (2003), places the green iguana as the closest relative of the
        mole skink
        (Plestiodon egregius). Lepidosaurs are reptiles with overlapping scales, and within this group
        both
        iguanians and tuataras (Sphenodons) project their tongue to seize prey items instead of using
        their jaw, which
        is called tongue prehension. However, iguanians are the only lineage within Squamata that
        displays this trait,
        meaning that it was gained independently in both iguanians and tuataras. Iguanians are also the
        only
        squamates that primarily use their sight to identify and track prey rather than chemoreception
        or scent, and
        employ an ambush technique of catching prey instead of active searching.
